On a longer time scale, however, production of ComS gets inhibited, which results in the MecA complex starting to degrade ComK instead of ComS. This brings ComK back to its pre-excitedment level.

If we could make the copy numbers of the components of the competence circuit have higher copy numbers, we could reduce intrinsic noise. To accomplish this, Süel and coworkers used a ftsW mutant that fails to septate; that is, the cells do not divide. The result is long cells with high copy numbers.\n",

The black curve is from experimental measurements and the gray curve from analysis of stochastic simulations similar to what we show in the next section of this notebook.

        "A given cell may go in to competence before it divides. This depends on the amount of time it takes to get kicked into competence by intrinsic noise. Once competent, the cell may remain competent for a short or a long time. This depends on the dynamics as it traverses the competent loop of the phase portrait.\n",
        "\n",
        "How can these two time scales, that is, the time scale to become competent and the time scale to return from competence, be tuned? Süel and coworkers found that these two time scales can be tuned *independently* by varying the constitutive expression of comK and comS, respectively, as parametrized by $\\alpha_k$ and $\\alpha_s$.\n",
        "\n",
        "This stands to reason. If we make more ComK (increase $\\alpha_k$), this pushes the circuit rightward in the phase portrait, into the competence loop. This results in shorter time to competence. \n",
        "\n",
        "ComS must be degraded to allows the MecA complex to degrade ComK. So, the faster a cell can get rid of ComS, the faster it can degrade ComK and return from competence. So, if we increase $\\alpha_s$, more ComS is around, and competence is prolonged.\n",
        "\n",
        "To study this quantitatively, we can take advantage of our ability to sample out of a probability distribution defined by a master equation. With samples, we can compute any quantity we like from them, including the amount of time before the circuit launches into competence and the amount of time it remains in competence. We need to modify some of the Gillespie simulation code to do this. First, we can code up the Gillespie draw, which is the same as in our lecture on the Gillespie SSA.\n"
